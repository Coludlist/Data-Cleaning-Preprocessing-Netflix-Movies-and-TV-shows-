# Data-Cleaning-Preprocessing-Netflix-Movies-and-TV-shows-

To prepare the raw dataset for analysis, I performed several cleaning and standardization steps using Excel.
I addressed incomplete data by using filters to identify and handle all rows containing missing (blank) values. I then ensured data integrity by utilizing Excel's 'Remove Duplicates' tool to eliminate all exact duplicate rows.
In every blank cell in the "Director" column, i hvae given values has 'Nickolas'.
In every blank cell in the "Cast" column, i hvae given values has 'John Wick'.
In every blank cell in the "Country" column, i hvae given values has 'England'.
In every blank cell in the "Date_Added" column, i hvae given values has 'August, 18'.
I standardized the data for consistency. This involved normalizing text-based fields, such as gender and country names, to correct typos and ensure uniform entries. I also converted all date columns to a single, consistent format (dd-mm-yyyy).
â€‹I cleaned the dataset's structure. I renamed all column headers to be uniform (using underscores instead of spaces).
